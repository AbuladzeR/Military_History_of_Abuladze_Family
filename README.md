# Military_History_of_Abuladze_Family
My publication about military history and lives of officers from Abuladze family.

This repository contains my book and resources used to write it.

I always had great interest in military history and great fascination with History in general, so I started working on this book when I first stumbled upon an online archive about First World War veterans, where I found some of my Ancestors and other members of Abuladze familiy, since finding that I tried to record and save all information about officers from Abuladze family who were veterans and fought in many historical battles, that's how I had an idea to write some kind of a book...

My resources mainly were online archives of old newspapers, publications, military journals, regiment officer lists and many more... I had to read through all of them mostly in Georgian and Russian, sometimes in English and couple of times in French and Polish.

Currently I am still working on this book and wait to have access to more archival documents.
